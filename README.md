# **Task-3-Linear-Regression**

1. Imported libraries
Used Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn.

2. Loaded the dataset
Read the housing price dataset from a CSV file.

3. Cleaned the data
Removed rows with missing values to avoid errors.

4. Selected columns
Used area as input (X) and price as output (y).

5. Split the data
Divided the data into training and testing parts (80% train, 20% test).

6. Trained a linear regression model
Built a model to learn the relationship between area and price.

7. Made predictions
Predicted prices using the test data and the full data (for plotting).

8. Evaluated the model
Calculated MAE, MSE, and RÂ² to check how good the model is.

9. Printed model results
Showed the slope and intercept of the regression line.

10. Plotted the graph
Drew a scatter plot of actual data and a red line for predicted prices (regression line).
